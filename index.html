    <p>Description:</p>
    <p>The goal of a dining tip calculator is to automatically calcuate a dining tip total or percentage for a customer, employee or employer. When at a restaurant, a customer may need to know how much their total will be by inputting their total bill, percent of tip, and number of people sharing that bill. The customer is unable to asks the waitress to do it, the employee would have to go through the sames steps after asking the customer how much they would like to tip, if at all. If an employee want's to see their average tip percentage for their employee's they could also calculate by scrolling to the bottom and inputting the information requested. The functions include adding a tip percent option including 10% 15%, 20% or custom amount to the final bill. The final amount can be paid by as many as one person or six people. If a user enters an amount that is not between 1 and 6, and error messgae pops up promting them to try again. The calculator outputs a tip and bill amount for each playerï¿¼. 
      Above is an image of the first rough draft of the calcultor encompassing all the basic functions of the tool.
